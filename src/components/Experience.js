Gamers can enhance their gaming experience with tournafest alongside improving skills and getting rewards for completing in events. Throughout these years i worked with the team to design the UI for the app helped them to get testimonials from users. I think most of the players use to play games for fun but what if they can win rewards while playing their favourite games. We at tournafest allows gamers to play their favourite while earning rewards from it. I mostly worked in operation parts handling day to day operation and team tasks. Apace with getting testimonials.</p>

                        <p className='text-md py-2 text-gray-400'>Matrix is a protocol that allows fans to own the brands they are consumers of by leveraging the possibilities enabled by DeFi and decentralised governance. Throughout these years i worked with the team to figure out what actually a Super fan is. I think lot of people fundamentally miss the mark when talking about ‘super fans’ When talking about Super fans people refers to those that will monetarily support in more costly ventures. But what people fails to talk about is Super fans that will spend a large portion of their social budget in you. That means they watch all your streams, all your tweets etc etc. We at Matrix allows both type of Super fans to benefit from the NFT experience based on based on their comparative advantage. Overall I believe that balancing act is the key encapsulating the most amount of value from your NFT’s.</p>
